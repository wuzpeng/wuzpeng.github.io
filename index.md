## Research Interests

- Embodied Perception
- Human-Object Interaction Understanding

My current research focuses on parsing elements in human-object interactions (HOIs), covering semantics, spatial relations, and geometries. Thest elements link interaction intentions to final operations, holding the potential to facilitate downstream applications like embodied AI and interaction modeling in graphics.
