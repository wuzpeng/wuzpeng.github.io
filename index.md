## Research Interests

- Embodied Perception
- Human-Object Interaction Understanding

My current research focuses on parsing 3D human-object interactions (HOIs), encompassing semantics, spatial relations, and geometries. The goal is to link interaction intentions with final operations through parsing interaction elements, thereby facilitating interaction reconstruction and generation in embodied AI and graphics.
